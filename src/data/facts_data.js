        img:iroh,
        fact:"If you were to make a list of impossible things that could have happened in the series finale, sweet Uncle Iroh stabbing Zuko in the back would probably be at the top. There isn't a more likeable character than Iroh in the entire series. He's wise, funny, powerful, and he's completely responsible for putting his troubled nephew on the path to redemption. However, Iroh's original role in the series was intended to betray Zuko in the series finale, acting as a double agent and throwing all of the character's rich history out the window in favor of a lazy twist. What a kick in the pants that would have been. Thankfully, the writers came to their senses, and Iroh finished the series with the happy ending he so deserved."

        title:"Toph Was Almost a Male Character",
        img:toph,
        fact:"Throughout the series, Toph mastered the art of earthbending and, later on, was heralded as the founder of metal-bending. She forged through, refusing to let her loss of sight impede her skills as an earthbender. Originally, however, Toph was designed as a male character with perfect vision. The episode 'Ember Island Players' nodded to an early concept of Toph by making her a Dwayne Johnson-like character in the show's parody of itself.."

        title:"The Show Almost Aired Without Zuko",
        img:Zuko,
        fact:"Even though Zuko started out as the series' most central villain, he quickly became a fan favorite character. Zuko's character arc was one of the best in the entire show. He begins as an impudent child, obsessed with the impossible task of finding the Avatar so he can please his father. Fans of The Last Airbender know just how important honor was to him. But then, he slowly matured. Through the tutelage of his Uncle Iroh, he began to understand the values that mattered not just to his father but to him. Soon, he was fully on the side of Team Avatar. But the creators of The Last Airbender didn't always plan to have Zuko in the mix. Originally, Fire Lord Ozai was meant to be the one and only villain for all three seasons. But when they tried to write the first few episodes, they found it a bit difficult to create tension when Ozai was so far away, doing nothing but sitting on his throne. So Prince Zuko was created and inspired one of the best storylines in the series."

        title:"The Show Was Going to Take Place Thousands of Years in the Future",
        img:future,
        fact:"The Last Airbender was first conceived in 2001 by Bryan Konietzko off nothing more than his sketch of a bald kid herding bison in the sky. He showed the drawing to fellow animator Michael DiMartino and the pair soon began work on a concept about an 'air guy' with some 'water people' who were getting pressed down on by some 'fire people.'That barebones concept is a far cry from the final product. However, even weirder is the fact that during this early stage, Konietzko and DiMartino were tinkering with the idea of placing the world of Avatar thousands of years into the future! In the end, the pair decided to scrap the sci-fi concept in favor of the older time period in which the show is set. Good thing, as Aang riding around in a flying car is far less interesting than a flying bison."
